Intro
=====

This package intends to provide integration tests for holland.  The basic
approach here is to do the following:

* Provide a set of MySQL binary distribution tarballs for each MySQL version to
  test 
* Setup a sandbox directory under ${sandbox_root}
* Run holland commands against this MySQL version by setting MYSQL_HOME to point
  to the correct MySQL installation and holland's [mysql:client] will pick that
  up via defaults-extra-files = .my.cnf

Configuration
=============
Tests are parameterized via nose-testconfig.
